This repository offers a complete math library where all functions were coded from the scratch.  
Here, you can find implementations like the ones in the, for instance, math.h header included in any C compiler.  
  
To develop this piece of software, we used, mainly, Taylor | Maclaurin Series and combinations of them.  
>  
> - Analytic functions: exp, log, log2, log10, pow, sqrt, curt, ithrt ...  
> - Trigonometric functions and its inverses.  
> - Hyperbolic functions.  
> - Other useful general pourpose functions.  
>  
  
The imr_math.h header is fully documented about what each function does.  
The example demonstrates all the funcions in the library.  
You can compile this code under any platform having a C compiler, since it uses only pure C code,  
that is, we do not use any standard or extern header.  
  
This work was done, mainly, for educational pourposes, addressed for audience interested in knowing how to code  
these fundamental functions, you can even found how to compute the 'e' and 'pi' constants.  
Hope that you appreciate and enjoy this work.
