imath.dll library; developed by Ismael Mosquera rivera

The library is already compiled and placed into the 'lib' folder.
Anyway, you can rebuild it executing the Makefile by type:
make

The imath.dll library, as you already know, works under MS-Windows, but if you can build them
to run under Linux, you only need to edit the simple Makefile and just
change the entries 'imath.dll' by 'imath.so'
