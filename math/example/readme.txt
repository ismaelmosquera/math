The example is already compiled, but if you wish to rebuild it just type
make

to execute the Makefile
To run the example, change to the bin folder and execute any of the simple scripts:
./run.sh
if you are under a Linux like shell, or
run
in case that you are using a 'cmd' MS-Windows command line.
After executing, an 'out.txt' file will be created and place into the 'bin' folder.
You can look inside this file to see a demonstration for every function in this math library.
